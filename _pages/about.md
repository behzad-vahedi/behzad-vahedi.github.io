I am a machine learning scientist with geospatial background and extensive experience in developing machine learning and deep learning solutions for a wide range of spatial and temporal problems, from COVID-19 predictive modeling to image segmentation in satellite imagery.

I have a B.Sc. in Geomatics Engineering and a M.Sc. in GIS Engineering from __K.N.Toosi University of Tech.__, a M.A. in Geography from __University of California Santa Barbara__ and am doing my PhD in Geography at __University of Colorado Boulder__. At CU Boulder, I'm a member of GeoHAI Lab directed by [Dr. Morteza Karimzadeh](https://www.colorado.edu/geography/morteza-karimzadeh) and am working on an NSF-funded project concerned with sea ice classification and mapping.


Research Interests
======
My main researh interests lie at the intersection of deep learning and spatial science, or GeoAI as known formally. 

Publication Highlights
======

Here are some of my most recent publications. To see a full list, please visit the [Publications](./publications/) page. 

- [A spatiotemporal machine learning approach to forecasting COVID-19 incidence at the county level in the USA](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41060-021-00295-9). __International Journal of Data Science and Analytics__, (2022). B Lucas, _B Vahedi_, M Karimzadeh.

Presentation Highlights

Here are some of my most recent talks. To see a full list, please visit the [Presentations](./talks/) page.

- A Comparison Of Classic Deep Learning Architectures For Sea Ice Classification From SAR. __AGU Fall Meeting 2021__, New Orleans, LA.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
