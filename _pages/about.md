I am a machine learning and deep learning scientist with geospatial background and experience in developing machine learning and deep learning solutions for a wide range of spatial and temporal problems, from COVID-19 predictive modeling to image segmentation in satellite imagery.

I have a __B.Sc. in Geomatics Engineering__ and a __M.Sc. in GIS Engineering__ from _K.N.Toosi University of Tech._, a __M.A. in Geography__ from _University of California Santa Barbara_ and am working on my __PhD in Geography__ at _University of Colorado Boulder_. At CU Boulder, I'm a member of GeoHAI Lab directed by [Dr. Morteza Karimzadeh](https://www.colorado.edu/geography/morteza-karimzadeh).


Research Interests
======
My main researh interests lie at the intersection of deep learning and spatial science, or GeoAI as known formally. 

__SKILLS:__

- __General__: Machine learning, Deep learning, Geospatial data science, Object-oriented design and programming, working with location data
- __Programming__: Python (proficient), C++ and JAVA (intermediate)
- __Data Science__: Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, JAX (intermediate)
- __Geospatial__: ArcGIS, QGIS, ENVI, Google Earth Engine, GeoPandas, RasterIO
