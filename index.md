## About Me

I am an applied machine learning scientist with a robust geospatial background and extensive experience in developing machine learning and deep learning solutions for spatial and temporal challenges. My expertise encompasses satellite image classification, COVID-19 forecasting, and Climate AI. My research has been featured in prestigious journals such as _Nature Communications_ and _Science of the Total Environment_. Additionally, I have industry experience in climate AI model development and DevOps.

Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Geography at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research focuses on leveraging spatial principles to optimize the design and performance of deep learning models, particularly at the intersection of computer vision and remote sensing. I am developing deep learning models for classifying sea ice in remotely sensed radar imagery. I am also a member of the GeoHAI Lab, directed by [Dr. Morteza Karimzadeh](https://www.colorado.edu/geography/morteza-karimzadeh).

I hold an M.A. in Geography from the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I was advised by [Dr. Werner Kuhn](https://people.geog.ucsb.edu/~kuhn/), as well as an M.Sc. in GIS Engineering and a B.Sc. in Geomatics Engineering from K.N. Toosi University of Technology.

I am open to industry positions in machine learning engineering or research, where I can contribute to innovative solutions and cutting-edge advancements.
