## About Me

I am an applied machine learning scientist with a geospatial background and extensive experience in developing machine learning and deep learning solutions for spatial and temporal problems, including satellite image classification, COVID-19 forecasting, and Climate AI. My research is published in prestigious journals such as Nature Communications and Science of the Total Environment. I also have industry experience in developing climate AI models and DevOps.

I have a B.Sc. in Geomatics Engineering and a M.Sc. in GIS Engineering from K.N.Toosi University of Tech., a M.A. in Geography from University of California Santa Barbara and am working on my PhD in Geography at University of Colorado Boulder. At CU Boulder, Iâ€™m a member of GeoHAI Lab directed by Dr. Morteza Karimzadeh.
